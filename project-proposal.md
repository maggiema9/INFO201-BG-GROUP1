<h1>**topic: the effects of climate change on sea level rise** </h1>

<h2>**Data and Audience** </h2>
The first set of [data](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/#:~:text=Global%20sea%20levels%20are%20rising,of%20seawater%20as%20it%20warms.) we are looking at is from NASA; they are a very reputable source when it comes to earth/science matters
  - considered a global leader when it comes to the study of climate [change](https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_science/history/#:~:text=NASA%20is%20a%20global%20leader,a%20broad%20climate%20research%20program.)
  
data that explains WHY sea level rise occurs, rather than just [numbers](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/sea-level-rise-2020/)

when it comes to the audience, [pew research center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/26/key-findings-how-americans-attitudes-about-climate-change-differ-by-generation-party-and-other-factors/) finds that there is a difference in a sense of urgengy within generations
  - pew research provides factual and unbiased news 
  - younger generations are more likely to address climate change issues
      - favor proposals to shift away from the use of fossil fuels

the audience should be able to answer: 
  1. what causes sea level rise? 
  2. what is the projection of sea level rise in the next few years/decades?
  3.

Data and Audience
- What is the dataset you’ll be working with? Please include background on who     collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we     should know about how this data came to be.

- Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may    be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should home in   on one of these audiences.

- What does your audience want to learn from your data? Please list out at least   3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.

Technical Description
- How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a    static .csv/.json file)?

- What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to   do to your data?

- What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list       common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

- What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical                  analysis/machine learning?

- What major challenges do you anticipate?

Project Set-up
- Create a public repository on GitHub in which you’ll be completing your final   projects. All group members should be added to the repo so they can push        directly to it

- Create 5 GitHub Issues as your first set of steps to take in the project. You   should assign these to individual group members to complete

- Optional: Create a slack/discord/… channel for your group to use for            communication.

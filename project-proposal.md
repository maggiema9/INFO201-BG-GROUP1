**topic: the effects of climate change on sea level rise** 

**Data and Audience** 
The first set of [data](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/#:~:text=Global%20sea%20levels%20are%20rising,of%20seawater%20as%20it%20warms.) we are looking at is from NASA; they are a very reputable source when it comes to earth/science matters
  - considered a global leader when it comes to the study of climate [change](https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_science/history/#:~:text=NASA%20is%20a%20global%20leader,a%20broad%20climate%20research%20program.)
  
data that explains WHY sea level rise occurs, rather than just [numbers](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/sea-level-rise-2020/)

when it comes to the audience, [pew research center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/26/key-findings-how-americans-attitudes-about-climate-change-differ-by-generation-party-and-other-factors/) finds that there is a difference in a sense of urgengy within generations
  - pew research provides factual and unbiased news 
  - younger generations are more likely to address climate change issues
      - favor proposals to shift away from the use of fossil fuels

the audience should be able to answer: 
  1. what causes sea level rise? 
  2. what is the projection of sea level rise in the next few years/decades?
  3.

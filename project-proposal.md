<h1>Topic: The Effects of Climate Change on Sea Level Rise </h1>

<h2>Data and Audience </h2>
What is the dataset youâ€™ll be working with? Please include background on who     collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we     should know about how this data came to be. 

- The first set of [data](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/#:~:text=Global%20sea%20levels%20are%20rising,of%20seawater%20as%20it%20warms.) we are looking at is from NASA; they are a very reputable source when it comes to earth/science matters
  - considered a global leader when it comes to the study of climate 
- [change](https://climate.nasa.gov/nasa_science/history/#:~:text=NASA%20is%20a%20global%20leader,a%20broad%20climate%20research%20program.)
  
- data that explains WHY sea level rise occurs, rather than just [numbers](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/sea-level-rise-2020/)

- when it comes to the audience, [pew research center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/26/key-findings-how-americans-attitudes-about-climate-change-differ-by-generation-party-and-other-factors/) finds that there is a difference in a sense of urgengy within generations
  - pew research provides factual and unbiased news 
  - younger generations are more likely to address climate change issues
      - favor proposals to shift away from the use of fossil fuels

    - land
    - population
    - GDP
    - agriculture
    - urban extent

  - [dates](https://hub.arcgis.com/documents/6ee23a29356a4fe6986b58ec4bcf446c/explore)
    - couldnt rlly access the files -- but could be good to look at
  - mean sea level [variation](https://www.statista.com/statistics/603821/global-cumulative-sea-level-rise/)

  - Who is your target audience? Depending on the domain of your data, there may    be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should home in   on one of these audiences.
    - High school/college students interested in a brief understanding of climate changes effects on sea level rise. 

the audience should be able to answer: 
  1. what causes sea level rise? 
  2. what is the projection of sea level rise in the next few years/decades?
  3. how does see level rise affect people?
  
<h1>technical description</h1>
How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a    static .csv/.json file)?

  - csv file

What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to   do to your data?
  - compiling together 
  - filtering for what's important 

What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list       common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)
  - ggplot
  - knitr

What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical                  analysis/machine learning?
  - Future projections

What major challenges do you anticipate?
  - Deciding which data sets and what data is most important to show
  - Compiling and sorting data
  - Projection calculations
